MotionJpegSlicer is a small library for processing Motion JPEG image streams.

The input stream (normally created by a network camera) is read and the images
contained in this stream are extracted. Clients of this library register with
the slicer and are notified by image events.

The library also provides a mock camera that generates Motion JPEG image streams.
